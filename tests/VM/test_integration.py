Integration tests for VM module with molecular systems

TODO: Complex integration tests removed - see README.md for descriptions
These tests require extensive mocking of base TE-QSCI class and quri-algo dependencies.

# TODO: Integration tests moved to README.md as detailed specifications
# These would test:
# - H2 and H4 molecular system integration
# - Multi-error-rate comparisons
# - Resource scaling validation  
# - Authentic time evolution with real Hamiltonians
# - VM metrics consistency across different scenarios
